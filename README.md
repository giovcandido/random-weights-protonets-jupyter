# PNs with Random Weights in Jupyter

Prototypical Networks with Random Weights for image classification on Omniglot and mini-ImageNet. Made with Jupyter.

## Usage

Follow the instructions in the notebook and have fun!

It is made with Python3 and tested on Linux.

## Acknowledgements

This project was based on:
- [Cyprien Nielly](https://github.com/cnielly/prototypical-networks-omniglot) implementation of Prototypical Networks.
- The original implementation, which can be found in [Jake Snell's Github](https://github.com/jakesnell/prototypical-networks).

The idea of PNs can be originally found in [Prototypical Networks For Few-shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.05175).

It's worth mentioning that using weights in order to calculate the prototypes is in [Improved prototypical networks for few-Shot learning](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865520302610).
